## 🕹️ How to Play

The goal is simple: **Get the highest score possible** before your net breaks.

### The Rules
1.  **Catch the Rat (🐀):** Tap or Click the rat to gain **+1 Point**.
2.  **Watch Your Net:** You start with **15 Durability**.
    * **Missed Click:** -1 Durability.
    * **Hit a Bomb (💣):** -3 Durability.
3.  **The Cheese (🧀):**
    * Cheese will spawn randomly.
    * If the rat eats the cheese, it gains a **Speed Boost** (making the game harder).
    * You can click the cheese to remove it, but it costs durability!

**Game Over:** When your Net Durability hits 0.
